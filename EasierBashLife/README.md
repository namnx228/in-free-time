# This is my .bashrc which contains many bash code to automatically manage my jobs in the High Performance Computer (HPC) of my previous university. It helps me to automatically submit jobs (computational tasks which are needed to be done by HPC) at free machines, save and stop jobs at a machine when someone needs it.
